## Automation Tools & Scripts

Throughout my career, I've developed dozens of automation scripts and tools for:
- Network device configuration management (Python, Bash)
- Firmware deployment automation (reduced deployment time by 80%)
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Data migration and transformation pipelines
- API testing and validation tools

Many of these tools are proprietary, but the patterns and approaches are reflected in my public repositories.
