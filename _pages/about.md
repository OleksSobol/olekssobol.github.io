# Oleks Sobol

Backend automation engineer. I build systems that eliminate manual work and let operations teams focus on what actually matters.

## The Short Version

My path into software started with frustration. As a network engineer managing hundreds of devices, I watched colleagues spend hours on repetitive tasks that should have been automated. So I wrote my first Python script to configure network equipment in bulk. That script saved 5 hours every week.

One script became ten. Ten became entire systems. What started as simple automation evolved into production-grade applications serving thousands of users. Today, my systems handle ISP customer onboarding, equipment management, and operational workflows — running in production with 99.9% uptime.

> I don't just write code. I solve problems that waste people's time.

## What I Bring

My network engineering background gives me a perspective most backend developers don't have:

- **Infrastructure-first thinking** — every API considers scalability, latency, and failure modes
- **Full-stack understanding** — from packet-level networking to application logic
- **Production mindset** — I build for real-world conditions: unstable networks, hardware failures, unpredictable load
- **Operations empathy** — monitoring, logging, and clear error messages come standard
