## What I Build

I specialize in backend automation for companies drowning in manual processes. If your team spends hours on repetitive data entry, account provisioning, report generation, or system management — I can build a solution that does it in seconds.

---

### Workflow Automation

Turn multi-step manual processes into one-click operations. Typical savings: 80-95% time reduction.

**Examples:** Customer onboarding, account provisioning, data migration, report generation, batch processing.

### API Integration & Development

Connect disconnected systems through custom API layers. Build internal tools that talk to your existing infrastructure.

**Examples:** Multi-vendor API orchestration, webhook pipelines, internal dashboards, data synchronization between platforms.

### Internal Tools & Dashboards

Custom web applications for internal operations. Purpose-built for your specific workflow — not a generic SaaS.

**Examples:** Admin panels, monitoring dashboards, configuration management interfaces, approval workflows.

## How I Work

### 1. Discovery (Free)
30-minute call to understand your workflow pain points. I ask questions. You describe what's eating your time.

### 2. Assessment
I map your current process, identify automation opportunities, and estimate ROI. You get a written proposal with scope and timeline.

### 3. Build
Iterative development with weekly demos. You see working software, not slide decks.

### 4. Deploy & Support
Production deployment with documentation and training. Optional ongoing support and maintenance.
