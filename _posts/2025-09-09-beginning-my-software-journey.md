I just got back from six weeks of backpacking trip on the **Continental Divide Trail (CDT)**.  
Those long miles gave me time to think, and I realized it’s time for a big change:  
I’m moving from **Network Engineering** into **Software Engineering**.  

---

### Early Sparks  
My first encounter with a computer was at **age 6**. It was magical.  
Like many kids, I was hooked by games. But curiosity pushed me deeper—I loved digging through menus, flipping switches, and breaking things just to see what would happen.  

That curiosity got me into some unexpected places (like discovering StripChess had a “hidden” setting most 6-year-olds probably shouldn’t have found). But it also gave me one important skill: I wasn’t afraid to **explore software and push buttons until I understood how it worked**.

### First Steps in Programming  
By the time I was **12 years old**, I stumbled into programming.  
My first language? **Pascal.** More specifically, Turbo Pascal—my very first IDE.  

From there I hopped between languages over the years:  
- C#  
- C / C++  
- Java  
- Assembler  
- JavaScript  
- Python  

I kept chasing whatever “hot” language or framework was trending. But eventually I realized: **chasing hype won’t make me the developer I want to be.**

### The Mental Block  
I’ve always been good at **fixing problems in other people’s projects**.  
But when it comes to building my own? That’s where I’ve struggled.  

I’d start projects with excitement but often drop them halfway through.  
Looking back, I think the missing piece was **deployment knowledge**. Writing code is one thing, but getting it running live, accessible, and finished is a whole other skillset.  

---

### The Turning Point  
Now, after the CDT and a lot of reflection, I’ve decided:  
- I want to be a **high-level developer**.  
- I need to focus on **finishing small projects**, not chasing languages.  
- I’ll invest in learning **deployment**, so my ideas actually see the light of day.  

I’ve spent years tinkering. Now it’s time to **ship**.

### Looking Forward  
I don’t expect this path to be easy. But it’s the one I’m most excited about.  
This blog will be my place to document the process—failures, breakthroughs, and everything in between.  

So here it begins: **the journey from Network Engineer to Software Engineer.**  
Stay tuned.
