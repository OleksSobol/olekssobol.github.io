## Overview

I'm Oleksandr (Oleks) Sobol, a Backend Software Developer with 4+ years of experience building automation pipelines and scalable systems. My journey from network engineering to software development has given me a unique perspective on infrastructure optimization and system reliability.

Currently based in Washington, I specialize in creating backend solutions that dramatically improve efficiency and reduce manual processes.

## Professional Experience

### Backend Software Developer Journey

My career began in network operations, where I quickly identified opportunities to automate repetitive tasks and improve system reliability. This led me to develop increasingly sophisticated automation tools, eventually transitioning fully into backend software development.

**Key Achievements:**
- Reduced customer onboarding from 20 minutes to under 1 minute (95% improvement)
- Decreased manual errors by 90% through automation pipelines
- Built production systems serving 4000+ clients
- Cut firmware deployment time by 80% with automated configuration management

At GlobalNet Inc., I led the development of critical automation infrastructure, designed scalable APIs, and mentored team members on technical problem-solving.
